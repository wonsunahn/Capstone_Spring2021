# CS CS1980/CS1640 CAPSTONE
Spring Semester 2020

## PROPOSAL PAPER

This proposal paper is required for all students in the *project* sections of the Capstone (CS1980 and CS1640).

It is not required for students in the internship or research sections (CS1900 and CS1950).

## FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS

The paper must be 4 pages or more in length, using a relatively standard font and point size (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman or Computer Modern).  Judicious use of charts, graphs, and/or illustrations is encouraged, especially if it helps me to understand the project.  Margins should be of standard size (1" or less).

Please ensure that your name as well as the name of the project you worked on is listed, along with the name of the customer.

This is a group project - only one proposal paper is expected from each group.

## DETAILS

In general, what I would like to see is a good understanding of what you are planning to do, why, and how.  This may also include division of labor (for example, if one student is going to focus on quality assurance and two others on development, or one student is going to focus on documentation, etc.)  All of this is subject to change as the semester goes on!

Here are some example questions I would like to see answered.  This does not mean that you need answer all of them, but I would recommend that you think about all of them now so you are not blindsided later.

1. How will you communicate?
2. What language will you use and why?
3. What frameworks did you use?
4. How will you test it?
5. What kind of architectural design will you use?
6. How will you be grouping the system into pieces of functionality or by subsystem?
7. What additional tools do you think you need?
8. What do you foresee as possible issues?
9. What systems will thus run on (OS X, Windows, Linux, etc)
10. How often and how will you meet with the customer?

You are *required* to have a prioritized list of user stories that you will be working on.  This list is subject to change but I want to see that you have at least put some thought into what will be required when developing the system.


## MANDATORY SECTION

In your project proposal, you must include a section that describes what are the goals of the project.
And when you predict those goals will be completed.

I suggest you describe these as user stories. But any format is acceptable.

You will need to get approval from your sponsor for the goals.
