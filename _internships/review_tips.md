## Review Requirements

A review must contain at minimum contain the following to be complete:

1. Scores on all categories.

1. Summary of project showing you paid attention.

1. One or more constructive comments that support your scoring.

## What is good feedback?

Feedback is most useful when:

1. It is constructive.  Instead of focusing on what went wrong, focus on ways to improve.

1. It is specific.  Vague comments like: "It was an interesting talk" or "It was hard to understand" are not helpful.  You must explain specifically what in the talk was interesting and what bullet point on what slide was hard to understand.

Obviously, to write good feedback, it is mandatory you take notes during the talk!

## Example of good feedback

-------------------- Begin Comment Section --------------------

Here are some pluses (+) and minuses (-) I found with your presentation:  
\+ You were engaging with the audience and mixing in some humor helped.  
\+ You made good eye contact with the entire room.  
\+ You spoke clearly and with good pacing.  
\+ I could feel your excitement with the work that you did which was infectious.  
\+ You explanation of technology X was clear and concise.  
\- You used technical terms like X and Y that you did not explain.  
\- You had a picture on Slide 4 that you did not refer to and it was hard to understand why it was there.  
\- You didn't mention a bullet point that said "X is Y" that looked interesting.  
\- Fonts were too small for my eyes!  
\- You gave a long verbal explanation for X and I think a diagram would have made sense.  

(End with a few feel good comments.)
