A Capstone Experience in the CS Department is one of three courses: CS 1980, CS 1900 and CS 1950. In addition to the individual requirements of each of these courses, associated with each are also required weekly meetings. During these meetings students will present their work and/or attend guest lectures.

## Who needs it? 	

All computer science majors are required to complete a Capstone Experience prior to graduation.

## Why? 	

* Students are given the opportunity to apply their newly gained knowledge in the field of Computer Science to a non-trivial, real-world project, either in industry or research
* Students are able to see and discuss each other's work, thereby showing them the diversity of areas in the field of Computer Science
* Students gain experience in presenting before an informed audience and in answering questions about their work
* Students gain experience in technical writing

# Health and Safety Statement

In the midst of this pandemic, it is extremely important that you abide by public health regulations and University of Pittsburgh health standards and guidelines. While in class, at a minimum this means that you must wear a face covering and comply with physical distancing requirements; other requirements may be added by the University during the semester. These rules have been developed to protect the health and safety of all community members. Failure to comply with these requirements will result in you not being permitted to attend class in person and could result in a Student Conduct violation. For the most up-to-date information and guidance, please visit coronavirus.pitt.edu and check your Pitt email for updates before each class.


# Take Care of Yourself

Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep, and taking time to relax. Despite what you might hear, using your time to take care of yourself will actually help you achieve your academic goals more than spending too much time studying. All of us benefit from support and guidance during times of struggle. There are many helpful resources available at Pitt. An important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Take the time to learn about all that’s available and take advantage of it. Ask for support sooner rather than later –this always helps. If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or difficult feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for assistance connecting to the support that can help.

The University Counseling Center is here for you: call 412-648-7930 and visit their website.

## File Backups
It is your responsibility to backup your work regularly. Please consider using reliable and multiple ways to protect your files! **I.e.: Please make backups, and backups of your backups, and...** (you get the point!)

You should be using github or gitlab! but even those can have issues: https://about.gitlab.com/2017/02/01/gitlab-dot-com-database-incident/

So always have a backup!
