## Your responsibilities

You have four responsibilities this term:

1. Give a presentation on your work.  See [Presentation organization](#presentation-organization).
   * Also come up with a question your classmates should be able to answer after your presentation. <br/><br/>

2. Write a final paper.  See [Final paper organization](#final-paper-organization).

3. Answer the presentation question and fill out peer reviews for each presentation (other than your own) on TopHat.  See [Peer review organization](#peer-review-organization)

4. CS 1950 students: send weekly (or bi-weekly depending on your meeting schedule) progress reports to your instructor and advisor by email, before the meeting.  See See [Progress report organization](#progress-report-organization).  The progress reports are meant to help you, not burden you.  The report allows your research advisor to get a summary update of your progress before starting a meeting.  The main consumer of the report is your research advisor, so you can use whatever format conveys the information best to your advisor.

If your presentation is not satisfactory, you will be asked to present once more with your instructor one-on-one outside of class hours.  This will be your final chance to give a satisfactory presentation.

If you submit your final paper at least one week before the deadline, you will be provided feedback and given a chance to resubmit if your paper is not satisfactory.

## Presentation organization

1. The Doodle poll is over.  Please see the final schedule below.
   * [Finalized Presentation Schedule]({{site.baseurl}}/internship_presentation_schedule)
   * CS 1900 students: Please choose dates between 2/5 ~ 4/2.
   * CS 1950 students: Please choose dates between 4/9 ~ 4/23.
   
2. These are the expected lengths of your presentation:
   * **15 minute presentation / 10 minutes Q&A**

3. Please review [lecture on presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture-on-presentations-internship.pdf) and [lecture on assertion evidence format]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture-on-assertion-evidence-format.pptx) before giving your presentation.  

4. Presenters must submit their presentation slides to the "Presentation
   Slides" assignment on Canvas the day before, by **Thursday midnight**.  The
slides will be uploaded to TopHat so that they can be reviewed by your
classmates.  The preferred format is PDF or Powerpoint.  

5. Presenters must also submit a presentation question to the "Presentation
   Question" assignment on Canvas by Thursday midnight.  The purpose of this
question is two fold: 1) To force the presenter to think about what they
expect the audience to learn from the presentation and 2) To measure how
successful the presenter was in conveying the concept.  Choose between a
multiple choice question or a fill-in-the-blank question.

   [Multiple choice example]

   Q: Which color is not represented in the RGB color model?  
   a) Red  
   b) Green  
   c) Blue  
   d) Beige  

   A: d) Beige

   [Fill-in-the-blank example]

   Q: An additive color model that adds together the colors of red, green, and blue to create a color is called the ______ color model.

   A: RGB

## Final paper organization

Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience.  For details, see the
[Final Paper Instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper).  PDF format is
preferred.  The paper should be submitted to Canvas by midnight of **April 23**.
Please consider submitting the paper earlier to get feedback.

## Peer review organization

For each presenter, there will be a folder in TopHat containing the slides for
the presentation, the question created by the presenter, and a few peer review
questions.  The TopHat questions should be submitted to TopHat by **Sunday
midnight** of the week of the presentation.  Please review [tips for writing a
good review]({{site.baseurl}}/review_tips).  Be specific about what you liked
and disliked.

The peer reviews will be anonymized and then provided to the presenter.  Note
that the peer reviews *will not impact the presenter's grade*.  You can give
honest feedback and scores without feeling guilty about lowering your friend's
grade.  The instructor will make the final determination on the quality of the
presentation.

The peer reviews will be made available as feedback on the "Presentation
Slides" assignment.  It will be attached as a .xlsx Excel file.

## Progress report organization

This is for CS 1950 students only.  Please send weekly (or bi-weekly depending
on your meeting schedule) progress reports to me and your advisor by email,
before each meeting.  The report allows your research advisor to get a summary
update of your progress before starting a meeting.  The main consumer of the
report is your research advisor, so you can use whatever format conveys the
information best to your advisor.  Your advisor will "approve" your report if
your progress is satisfactory -- otherwise feedback will be given.

My job as course instructor is to monitor the progress reports and facilitate
communication with you and your advisor.  Remember, the progress reports are
meant to help you, not burden you.  

## Attendance

This is a synchronous web-based class.  If you cannot participate synchronously
for some reason, please let me know asap.
